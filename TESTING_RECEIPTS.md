# Testing Receipt Functionality

## The Issue You're Experiencing

The 404 error when clicking "Download Receipt" is **expected behavior** because:

1. The booking ID `86f870f9-ae92-4043-96d3-86db998b011c` doesn't exist in your database
2. Even if it existed, receipts are only available for **paid bookings**
3. Users can only download receipts for their own bookings (security feature)

## How to Test Receipt Functionality

### Option 1: Test with Sample Receipt (Quick Test)

1. **Visit the test receipt URL**: 
   ```
   http://localhost:3002/api/test-receipt
   ```

2. **This will show you**:
   - How the receipt looks and functions
   - Professional receipt design
   - All receipt features working
   - Sample data from a completed booking

### Option 2: Create a Real Booking (Full Test)

1. **Set up your database** (if not done already):
   - Go to your Supabase dashboard
   - Run the SQL from `/database/schema.sql`
   - Run the SQL from `/database/add-admin-role.sql`
   - Run the SQL from `/database/add-notes-column.sql`

2. **Create a real booking**:
   - Go to `http://localhost:3002/book`
   - Complete all 5 steps of the booking process
   - Note the booking ID that gets created

3. **Complete payment** (if payment is set up):
   - Go through the payment flow
   - Mark the booking as paid

4. **Test receipt download**:
   - Go to your dashboard: `http://localhost:3002/dashboard`
   - Find your booking with "Paid" status
   - Click "Download Receipt"

### Option 3: Mock a Paid Booking in Database

If you have database access, you can create a test booking:

```sql
-- Insert a test user profile
INSERT INTO profiles (id, full_name, phone, email) VALUES 
('your-user-id-here', 'Test User', '+371 20123456', 'test@example.com');

-- Insert a test booking with paid status
INSERT INTO bookings (
  id, user_id, pickup_address, destination_address,
  departure_time, distance_km, passenger_count, luggage_count,
  total_price, base_price, payment_status, status
) VALUES (
  '86f870f9-ae92-4043-96d3-86db998b011c',
  'your-user-id-here',
  'Riga Airport',
  'Old Town Riga',
  NOW() + INTERVAL '1 day',
  12,
  2,
  1,
  35.50,
  30.00,
  'paid',
  'confirmed'
);
```

## Why You're Seeing the 404

The error `86f870f9-ae92-4043-96d3-86db998b011c:1 Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 (Not Found)` means:

1. **Booking doesn't exist**: The ID is not in your database
2. **Security working**: The system correctly prevents access to non-existent bookings
3. **Proper error handling**: The API returns appropriate HTTP status codes

## Next Steps

1. **Quick test**: Visit `http://localhost:3002/api/test-receipt` to see the receipt design
2. **Full test**: Create a real booking through the booking flow
3. **Database setup**: Ensure your Supabase database has the correct schema and data

The receipt system is **working correctly** - you just need real booking data to test it with!
