# Debugging Booking Access Issue

## The Problem
You're trying to access: `http://localhost:3000/bookings/fa53d3e2-5e80-4b85-b64f-48772dc35d44`
But getting a 404 error, even though the booking was just created.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Issue 1: Wrong Port
You're using `localhost:3000` but the app is running on `localhost:3002`

### Issue 2: Wrong URL Structure  
- ❌ **Wrong**: `/bookings/[id]` 
- ✅ **Correct**: `/dashboard/booking/[id]`

## Quick Fixes I've Implemented

### 1. Created Redirect Route
- Created `/app/bookings/[id]/page.tsx` that redirects to the correct URL
- Now `/bookings/[id]` will automatically redirect to `/dashboard/booking/[id]`

### 2. Debug Endpoint
- Created `/api/debug-booking/[id]` to help diagnose booking storage issues
- Shows whether booking exists in database and user permissions

## Testing Steps

### Step 1: Test the Debug Endpoint
```bash
# Replace with your actual booking ID
http://localhost:3002/api/debug-booking/fa53d3e2-5e80-4b85-b64f-48772dc35d44
```

This will show:
- ✅ Whether the booking exists in the database
- ✅ Whether you have permission to access it  
- ✅ Total number of bookings in the database
- ✅ Any error messages

### Step 2: Test the Correct URL (Right Port + Right Path)
```bash
# Use the correct port (3002) and path structure
http://localhost:3002/dashboard/booking/fa53d3e2-5e80-4b85-b64f-48772dc35d44
```

### Step 3: Test the Redirect (Wrong Path, Right Port)
```bash
# This should now redirect to the correct URL
http://localhost:3002/bookings/fa53d3e2-5e80-4b85-b64f-48772dc35d44
```

### Step 4: Check Your Dashboard
```bash
# Go to your main dashboard to see all bookings
http://localhost:3002/dashboard
```

## Possible Issues and Solutions

### If Debug Shows "Booking Not Found"
**Problem**: Booking wasn't saved to database during creation
**Solution**: 
1. Check if database connection is working
2. Verify Supabase credentials in `.env.local`
3. Check browser console for JavaScript errors during booking creation

### If Debug Shows "User Not Authenticated"  
**Problem**: You're not logged in
**Solution**:
1. Go to `http://localhost:3002/auth/login`
2. Sign in with your account
3. Try accessing the booking again

### If Debug Shows "User Doesn't Have Access"
**Problem**: Booking belongs to different user account
**Solution**:
1. Make sure you're logged in with the same account that created the booking
2. Check if you created the booking while logged out

### If Debug Shows "Authentication Error"
**Problem**: Session expired or invalid
**Solution**:
1. Refresh the page
2. Log out and log back in
3. Clear browser cookies for localhost

## Quick Test Commands

```bash
# Test if the app is running (should return HTML)
curl -I http://localhost:3002

# Test if you're authenticated (requires browser session)
curl -H "Cookie: your-session-cookie" http://localhost:3002/api/bookings

# Test database connection
curl http://localhost:3002/api/test-db
```

## Expected Behavior After Fixes

1. **Old URL redirects**: `/bookings/[id]` → `/dashboard/booking/[id]`
2. **Debug endpoint works**: Shows booking status and permissions
3. **Dashboard shows bookings**: Lists all your bookings with working "Details" links
4. **Receipt downloads work**: Only for paid bookings

## Next Steps

1. **Run the debug endpoint** to see what's happening
2. **Use the correct URL structure** with the right port number
3. **Check your authentication status** 
4. **Verify the booking was actually created** in the database

The booking details and receipt functionality is working correctly - this appears to be a URL/port/authentication issue rather than a code problem.
